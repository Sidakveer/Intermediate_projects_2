Using various modules such as **smtplib, pandas, datetime and more.** to build interesting projects.
## Birthday_Wisher
This project contains a program which automates the process of sending out emails to people in our .csv file on their birthdays. The program uses **pandas** 
to work with the csv file and **smtplib** module to build a connection with the email servers and send out emails from the users email address. The **datetime** module helps to keep a track of the current 
day and month to check if anyone from the guest list has a birthday or not.
